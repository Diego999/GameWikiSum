# GameWikiSum - LREC 2020

GameWikiSum, a new domain-specific (video game) dataset for multi-document summarization, which is one hundred times larger than commonly used datasets, and in another domain than news. Input documents consist of long professional video game reviews as well as references of their gameplay sections inWikipedia pages.

You can download the data [here](https://filesender.switch.ch/filesender2/?s=download&token=783b5392-be3d-4ea2-b4cb-265fa6faf91f). The use of the data set is restricted to academic research purpose only.

  abstract  = {Today's research progress in the field of multi-document summarization is obstructed by the small number of available datasets. Since the acquisition of reference summaries is costly, existing datasets contain only hundreds of samples at most, resulting in heavy reliance on hand-crafted features or necessitating additional, manually annotated data. The lack of large corpora therefore hinders the development of sophisticated models. Additionally, most publicly available multi-document summarization corpora are in the news domain, and no analogous dataset exists in the video game domain. In this paper, we propose GameWikiSum, a new domain-specific dataset for multi-document summarization, which is one hundred times larger than commonly used datasets, and in another domain than news. Input documents consist of long professional video game reviews as well as references of their gameplay sections in Wikipedia pages. We analyze the proposed dataset and show that both abstractive and extractive models can be trained on it. We release GameWikiSum for further research: https://github.com/Diego999/GameWikiSum.},

                    "check vs . mate is a title i heard about while over in europe back in 2010 ( known as battle vs . chess in the european countries ) . it was a title that promised me my childhood . the 3 - page fold - out poster that came with the local german magazine offered me so much . battle chess would be back with a burning vengeance .",
                    "a little back story : back in the days of old when people had to use dos to play games and illiterate people were unable to operate a computer , battle chess came out . it was a simple game that had 2 modes : versus ai or versus another player . back then , skill settings for the computer didn\u2019t exist and every match against the computer was a slow but sure defeat . it was a game that occupied much of my childhood as i intentionally offered pieces to the enemy just to watch the unique ways they could kill each other off ( all 6 chess pieces had a way to call any of the other 6 , making this game quite entertaining on a rainy day ) . it was a more innocent time back then .",
                    "as they say , the first thing lost in war \u2013 and lousy video games \u2013 is innocence . i\u2019ve quickly come to the realization that any game i want to be decent this year is going to let me down . check vs . mate has only served to prove my theory . before i sorrowfully load into the game\u2019s flaws , i do feel obligated to mention its strengths . the graphics are beautifully displayed cartoon designs . additionally , there is a difference between the black and white pieces , allowing for a total of 12 unique characters . it even has some pretty decent sound . so where did check vs . mate go wrong ? it got lazy sometime after they finished designing the characters .",
                    "the first error is that it lacks personality . battle chess was a very simple title . it had a total of 6 characters and a blue and red version of each . the updated check vs . mate has a total of 12 unique avatars and should therefore be capable of even more death animations than its predecessor . however , this is where things begin to go wrong . regardless of which piece is captured , every unit will have the same kill . whether it\u2019s a slash , a breath of fire , or a simple swing of a massive stone mace , all the kills are the same . a bishop will kill a queen in the same manner he uses to end a pawn , and so will a rook . while these make fine filler animations , the meat is gone . it\u2019s bland and boring . players would have as much fun with this title as any of the countless free online chess sites available to them .",
                    "but wait ! there\u2019s additional features , right ? there\u2019s a paper thin ddr - style battle system , and a \u2018tactical\u2019 combat gameplay mode ( both of which destroy traditional chess rules in favor of mindless mini - game fun ) . additionally , one of the designers must have read a scenario book , because the game offers a few cute puzzles for when a full game of chess isn\u2019t what the player wants . even the alleged storyline is just puzzles with text before them .",
                    "check vs . mate screams half - baked . if i didn\u2019t know that it\u2019s been out over in home turf england for the last year , i\u2019d be convinced i was playing a bootleg port of the alpha . it\u2019s an incomplete title that tripped twenty meters at the finish line and didn\u2019t even feel the need to get up for third place . rather , it sprinted off the track to go hang out with operation raccoon city behind the bleachers .",
                    "perhaps the biggest insult in all of this is the multiplayer system . chess is designed to be played with someone else , and while the single computer play works just fine , the online is straight out of networking hell . it\u2019s a system that took my buddy and i two hours to get working properly \u2013 and we had to use tuungle to do it . put simply , it\u2019s just not worth your time .",
                    "in the game\u2019s defense , it is a solid chess title . most children getting into chess would probably have a blast with it . the problem is that it\u2019s not what we were promised and it\u2019s not what it should be . check vs . mate could have been very good if the developers hadn\u2019t been lazy with character animations , or if someone had taken the time to write a legitimate story . plus , the multiplayer experience is difficult for anyone who isn\u2019t certified through comptia . had some more time been put into it , this could easily have brought in flocks of old gamers who haven\u2019t touched computers since king\u2019s quest stopped being 2d . however , check vs . mate is an empty attempt that i can see being sold on steam for $ 3 during the christmas sale .",

            "preprocessed_summary": "year of the dragon is set primarily in the third - person ; its gameplay makes few deviations from that of its predecessors . the main objective of the game is to collect special dragon eggs which are scattered across 37 worlds . these eggs are hidden , or are given as rewards for completing certain tasks and levels . the worlds of spyro are linked together by \" homeworlds \" or \" hubs \" , large worlds which contain gateways to many other levels . to proceed to the next hub , the character must complete five worlds , gather a certain number of eggs , and defeat a boss . players do not need to gather every egg to complete the main portion of the game or gain access to new levels ; in fact , certain eggs can only be found by returning to the world at a later time . gems are scattered across the worlds , hidden in crates and jars . these gems are used to bribe a bear named moneybags to release captured \" critters \" and activate things which help spyro progress through levels ( such as bridges ) . gems , along with the number of eggs collected , count to the total completion percentage of the game . the player controls the dragon spyro for most of the game . spyro ' s health is measured by his companion sparx , a dragonfly who changes color and then disappears after taking progressively more damage . if the player does not have sparx , then the next hit would cause the player to lose a life and restart at the last saved checkpoint . consuming small wildlife known as \" fodder \" regenerates sparx . spyro has several abilities , including breathing fire , swimming and diving , gliding , and headbutting , which he can use to explore and combat a variety of enemies , most of which are rhinoceros - like creatures called rhynocs . some foes are only vulnerable to certain moves . spyro can run into \" powerup gates \" , which give him special abilities for a limited period . year of the dragon introduced playable characters other than spyro , known as \" critters \" , which are gradually unlocked as the player proceeds through the game . critters can be found blocking the level they are played in until released from moneybags . subsequently , the player plays as the character in specially marked sections of levels . each homeworld features one world which is played through entirely by a non - spyro character . there are a total of seven playable characters , which all have their own special moves and abilities . sheila the kangaroo , for example , can double jump , while sgt . byrd is armed with rocket launchers and can fly indefinitely . besides the primary quest to find dragon eggs , year of the dragon features an extensive set of minigames , which are split off from the levels into smaller zones . some of the minigames were featured in spyro 2 : ripto ' s rage ! and were subsequently expanded for year of the dragon , while others are entirely new to the series . these minigames are played by spyro or the other playable characters .",

It was a title that promised me my childhood. The 3-page fold-out poster that came with the local German magazine offered me so much. Battle Chess would be back with a burning vengeance.\n\n\n\nA little back story: Back in the days of old when people had to use DOS to play games and illiterate people were unable to operate a computer, Battle Chess came out. It was a simple game that had 2 modes: versus AI or versus another player. Back then, skill settings for the computer didn\u2019t exist and every match against the computer was a slow but sure defeat. It was a game that occupied much of my childhood as I intentionally offered pieces to the enemy just to watch the unique ways they could kill each other off (all 6 chess pieces had a way to call any of the other 6, making this game quite entertaining on a rainy day). It was a more innocent time back then.\n\n\n\nAs they say, the first thing lost in war \u2013 and lousy video games \u2013 is innocence. I\u2019ve quickly come to the realization that any game I want to be decent this year is going to let me down. Check vs. Mate has only served to prove my theory. Before I sorrowfully load into the game\u2019s flaws, I do feel obligated to mention its strengths. The graphics are beautifully displayed cartoon designs. Additionally, there is a difference between the black and white pieces, allowing for a total of 12 unique characters. It even has some pretty decent sound. So where did Check vs. Mate go wrong? It got lazy sometime after they finished designing the characters.\n\n\n\nThe first error is that it lacks personality. Battle Chess was a very simple title. It had a total of 6 characters and a blue and red version of each. The updated Check vs. Mate has a total of 12 unique avatars and should therefore be capable of even more death animations than its predecessor. However, this is where things begin to go wrong. Regardless of which piece is captured, every unit will have the same kill. Whether it\u2019s a slash, a breath of fire, or a simple swing of a massive stone mace, all the kills are the same. A bishop will kill a queen in the same manner he uses to end a pawn, and so will a rook. While these make fine filler animations, the meat is gone. It\u2019s bland and boring. Players would have as much fun with this title as any of the countless free online chess sites available to them.\n\n\n\nBut wait! There\u2019s additional features, right? There\u2019s a paper thin DDR -style battle system, and a \u2018tactical\u2019 combat gameplay mode (both of which destroy traditional chess rules in favor of mindless mini-game fun). Additionally, one of the designers must have read a scenario book, because the game offers a few cute puzzles for when a full game of chess isn\u2019t what the player wants. Even the alleged storyline is just puzzles with text before them.\n\n\n\nCheck vs. Mate screams half-baked. If I didn\u2019t know that it\u2019s been out over in home turf England for the last year, I\u2019d be convinced I was playing a bootleg port of the alpha. It\u2019s an incomplete title that tripped twenty meters at the finish line and didn\u2019t even feel the need to get up for third place. Rather, it sprinted off the track to go hang out with Operation Raccoon City behind the bleachers.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest insult in all of this is the multiplayer system. Chess is designed to be played with someone else, and while the single computer play works just fine, the online is straight out of networking hell. It\u2019s a system that took my buddy and I two hours to get working properly \u2013 and we had to use Tuungle to do it. Put simply, it\u2019s just not worth your time.\n\n\n\nIn the game\u2019s defense, it is a solid chess title. Most children getting into chess would probably have a blast with it. The problem is that it\u2019s not what we were promised and it\u2019s not what it should be. Check vs. Mate could have been very good if the developers hadn\u2019t been lazy with character animations, or if someone had taken the time to write a legitimate story. Plus, the multiplayer experience is difficult for anyone who isn\u2019t certified through CompTIA. Had some more time been put into it, this could easily have brought in flocks of old gamers who haven\u2019t touched computers since King\u2019s Quest stopped being 2D. However, Check vs. Mate is an empty attempt that I can see being sold on Steam for $3 during the Christmas sale.\n\n\n\nShare this post\n\n\n\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nGiveaway - Warface: Collector's Early Access Pack Worth \u00a361.99\n\n\n\nFull details \u203a\n\n\n\nVersion tested:\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nDeveloper:\n\n\n\nTargem Games\n\n\n\nPublisher:\n\n\n\nTopWare Interactive\n\n\n\nGenre:\n\n\n\nStrategy, Board Game\n\n\n\nStaying up to date\n\n\n\nReceive email updates\n\n\n\nYouTube channel 99k subscribers\n\n\n\nFollow on twitter\n\n\n\nRSS Feed\n\n\n\nLike our Facebook page\n\n\n\nWrite news for DarkZero\n\n\n\nWe're looking for a new face to join our team of volunteers.

            "summary": "Year of the Dragon is set primarily in the third-person; its gameplay makes few deviations from that of its predecessors. The main objective of the game is to collect special dragon eggs which are scattered across 37 worlds. These eggs are hidden, or are given as rewards for completing certain tasks and levels. The worlds of Spyro are linked together by \"homeworlds\" or \"hubs\", large worlds which contain gateways to many other levels. To proceed to the next hub, the character must complete five worlds, gather a certain number of eggs, and defeat a boss. Players do not need to gather every egg to complete the main portion of the game or gain access to new levels; in fact, certain eggs can only be found by returning to the world at a later time. Gems are scattered across the worlds, hidden in crates and jars. These gems are used to bribe a bear named Moneybags to release captured \"critters\" and activate things which help Spyro progress through levels (Such as bridges). Gems, along with the number of eggs collected, count to the total completion percentage of the game.The player controls the dragon Spyro for most of the game. Spyro's health is measured by his companion Sparx, a dragonfly who changes color and then disappears after taking progressively more damage. If the player does not have Sparx, then the next hit would cause the player to lose a life and restart at the last saved checkpoint. Consuming small wildlife known as \"fodder\" regenerates Sparx. Spyro has several abilities, including breathing fire, swimming and diving, gliding, and headbutting, which he can use to explore and combat a variety of enemies, most of which are rhinoceros-like creatures called Rhynocs. Some foes are only vulnerable to certain moves. Spyro can run into \"Powerup Gates\", which give him special abilities for a limited period.Year of the Dragon introduced playable characters other than Spyro, known as \"critters\", which are gradually unlocked as the player proceeds through the game. Critters can be found blocking the level they are played in until released from Moneybags. Subsequently, the player plays as the character in specially marked sections of levels. Each homeworld features one world which is played through entirely by a non-Spyro character. There are a total of seven playable characters, which all have their own special moves and abilities. Sheila the Kangaroo, for example, can double jump, while Sgt. Byrd is armed with rocket launchers and can fly indefinitely.Besides the primary quest to find dragon eggs, Year of the Dragon features an extensive set of minigames, which are split off from the levels into smaller zones. Some of the minigames were featured in Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage! and were subsequently expanded for Year of the Dragon, while others are entirely new to the series. These minigames are played by Spyro or the other playable characters.",
